Project Title: Smart Hydration Monitoring System
1. Introduction: Dehydration is a significant health concern, and maintaining proper hydration levels is crucial for 
overall well-being. This project aims to develop a comprehensive and user-friendly solution for hydration monitoring 
by integrating wearable sensors with MongoDB and Python. The system will provide real-time hydration status data, 
store it efficiently in MongoDB, and leverage Python's analytical capabilities to offer personalized insights into 
hydration patterns.
2. Objectives:
• Connect wearable sensors (e.g., sweat sensors) to a central server for real-time hydration data collection.
• Store and manage the massive amount of sensor data using MongoDB, a NoSQL database.
• Utilize Python in Google Colab to develop code for data collection, storage, and analysis.
• Enable easy retrieval of hydration data for personalized insights and analysis.
• Ensure scalability and flexibility to accommodate the dynamic nature of hydration data over time.
3. Methodology:
• Data Collection:
• Wearable sensors will measure hydration levels and transmit real-time data to a central server.
• Python code in Google Colab will be developed to facilitate seamless data collection and transmission.
• Data Storage:
• MongoDB, a NoSQL database, will be employed to store and manage the massive amount of sensor data 
efficiently.
• The database will ensure scalability and flexibility to adapt to changing hydration data patterns.
• Data Analysis:
• Python will be used for data analysis, offering the versatility and power of a widely used programming 
language.
• The goal is to provide personalized insights into hydration patterns, enabling users to make informed 
decisions about their hydration habits.
